# Archaeological Science
I am currently studying in the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Programme in Archaeological Materials Science (ARCHMAT), jointly offered by the University of Évora, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and Sapienza University of Rome. More information about the program can be found https://www.erasmusmundus-archmat.uevora.pt/curriculum.html

This repository contains a selection of my coursework and research completed as part of the ARCHMAT program, including:

- a paper on archaeoacoustic investigations of a Megalithic monument in Great Britain, created for a course on Prehistoric Archaeology
- a paper summarizing an introductory excavation practice course, based on fieldwork at the prehistoric settlement of Monte da Ponte near Évora, Portugal
- a research project about Lemnian Earth, created during the ARCHMAT Summer School, exploring how cultural heritage and contemporary life intersect
- a paper on multispectral photogrammetry in cultural heritage science, prepared for the course Digital Techniques and Laboratory Practice in Archaeological Materials Science
- a presentation on the use of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for the investigation of Portland cement in the conservation of building cultural heritage
