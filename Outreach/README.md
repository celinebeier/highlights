# Science Outreach
These are some of the designs and files I have created for science outreach events I organized. It includes:

- In 2023, I organized Wikipedia workshop at McGill with the non-profit organization Arts+Feminism focused on increasing the visibilty of Canadian eomen in physics. Details about the event can be found here:

- In 2022, I was part of the organizing comitee for the 2022 Canadian Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CCUWIP) held online at the University of Alberta. I was responsible for planning the conference schedule, inviting guests for talks and workshops and panels and hosting the events. I also created some advertisment material shown here and the conference website:
