# Science Outreach
These are some of the designs and files I have created for science outreach events I organized. It includes:

- Wikipedia workshop at McGill with the non-profit organization Arts+Feminism. Details about the event can be found here: https://artandfeminism.org/edit_a_thon/mcgill-wikipedia-edit-a-thon/
- the report of my summer internship working on laser frequency stabilisation at TRIUMF
- the presentation I gave about this work at the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference (CUPC) 2019 in Montreal
- lab reports from my physics labs at university
- oral presentation for a lab course on image registration (in German)
- python scripts created as assignments for a Python coding course
- a thesis I wrote in high school after working on the rheological properties of Prussian blue for about 3 years (in German)
- the poster summarising this thesis for a youth science competetion (Jugend Forscht) (in German)



A complete list of my outreach activities can be found in my resume.
