# Highlights
Hello! I’m Celine, a physicist currently completing a Master’s in Archaeological Materials Science. I love this field and would love to continue in it, so I’m currently looking for a PhD starting in Fall 2026 / Winter 2027.

I’m particularly interested in projects that address meaningful historical or archaeological questions and allow me to engage with all stages of research, from excavation and sample collection to scientific analysis and interpretation. I’m excited about working with different techniques, and I would love to contribute to projects where methodological innovation directly supports answering questions about the past. I’m happy to work with a variety of materials and I’m open to different historical or archaeological contexts.
