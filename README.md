# Highlights
Hello! I’m Celine, a physicist currently completing a Master’s in Archaeological Materials Science. I love this field and would love to continue in it, so I’m currently looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2026 / Winter 2027.

I’m particularly interested in projects that explore interesting historical or archaeological questions and allow me to be involved all stages of research, from excavation and sample collection to scientific analysis and interpretation. I’m excited about working with different physical and chemical analytical techniques, and I would love to contribute to projects where methodological innovation directly supports answering questions about the past. I’m happy to work with a variety of materials and I’m open to different historical or archaeological contexts.

In this repository, you can find some of my previous work in physics, projects from my current Master’s in Archaeological Materials Science and examples of my science communication work.
