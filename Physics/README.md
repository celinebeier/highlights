- my Master thesis with the ATLAS group at McGill University
- a paper and presentation on water Cherenkov detectors for a graduate detector physics course
- my Bachelor thesis with the LHCb group at Heidelberg University
- an internship report on laser frequency stabilisation at TRIUMF
- my presentation for the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference (CUPC) 2019
