# Highlights
This is a selection of some of the physics-related work I have done in university and before. It includes: 

- my Master thesis with the ATLAS group at McGill University
- a paper and presentation on water Cherenkov detectors for a gradutae detector physics course
- my Bachelor thesis with the LHCb group at Heidelberg University
- the report of my summer internship working on laser frequency stabilisation at TRIUMF
- the presentation I gave about this work at the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference (CUPC) 2019 in Montreal
- lab reports from my physics labs at university
- presentation for a lab course on image registration (in German)
- a thesis I wrote in high school after working on the rheological properties of Prussian blue for about 3 years (in German)
